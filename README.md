About Me


I’m a motivated learner with a strong interest in UI/UX Design 🎨, Web Development 💻, and Data Analytics 📊. I enjoy transforming ideas into user-friendly digital experiences using tools like Figma and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,  ReactJS and MySQL.

I have hands-on experience working with vibe coding tools like V0 by Vercel, Lovable, Bolt, Windsurf, and Google AI Studio, along with Excel, Power BI, and Tableau ⚙️📈. I have developed projects including an online book purchasing website (designed in Figma), a personal AI assistant using Google AI Studio, a self-built portfolio website created during my internship, a to-do list application using Bolt, and other web-based applications. These projects have helped me strengthen both my design and development skills through practical, real-world experience.

I am continuously learning, improving my problem-solving abilities, and preparing myself for industry-ready challenges 🚀✨.
